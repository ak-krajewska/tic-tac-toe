//create the function that starts the game which does the following
    //set the endgame pop-up to invistible at the start
    //populate the scoreBoard array using Array.from and Array.keys
    //iterate through all the visible cells and do the following things
        //make them blank
        //clear them of color (which we use later to mark a winner)
        //add an event listener to each cell that calls another function (turnClick) that contorls what happens when you click

//create the function that controls what happens when you click on a square (takes a parameter "square" so you know what square you're manipulating)
    //check that no one has played in the suare yet if true then do:
        //the human takes their turn using the turn() function, which takes two paramaters, the id of the square, and the player (as in human or computer)
        //the computer takes their turn
            //the computer checks if it's a tie, and if it's not a tie
            //the computer takes its turn using the turn function, which takes two paramaters, the id of the suare and the player


//create the turn function, which take two paramaters: the id of the square in play, and the player
    //update the place in the scorekeeping array with the token of the current player (for example human is O, clics the middle top square now the array is 0 O 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
    //update the visual display so the player's token appears in the square (hint: use innerText)
    //use a checkWin function (which takes 2 parameters, scoreboard, and player); assign the output of the function to a local variable (gameWon) using the "let" keywor (instead of "var") (this will return either null which is falsy or some object, I think, which is truthy
    //if gameWon is truthy, pass the gameWon object into the gameOver function

//create the checkwin() function which takes two paramaters: the state of the scoreboard, and the current player
    //create a local variable plays, which is an array, which contains only those plays on the scoreboard that were placed by the current player --> hint, use Array.reduce on the board, also this is where the original uses ES6 style but you do you
    //create a local variable gameWon and set its default to null
    //////here it gets a little conceptually tricky/////
    ////this bit is all thinking through one line of code///
    //using for..of keyword, iteratie through every subarray in the winning combinations array -- check here for how https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries
    //for the index and array pair of each item in the array of winning combination arrays 
    /////here ends thinking about that one line of code
        //if (we iterate over every element in the win combo --> taking each element and checking if it's found inside the plays array --> and find it's found)(hint use "every" method)
        //then we set gameWon to a key-value array pair of index:index and player: player
        //leave the function with a break as soon as you win because no need to go fruther
    //return the gameWon which we have just determined

//create the gameOver funciton which takes the gameWon returned from checkwin() as a parameter
    //highlight the squares that are part of the winning combos
    //use the index of the gameWon to call the right winCombos
    //and then use getElementById to color the square
    //do a ternery operation to determine what color, humans one color, computer a different color

//create the declareWinner function that takes one paramater (who)
    //set the modal to display
    //set the text of the modal to be who won (human or computer)

//create the funciton emptySquares
        //filter the scoreboard array and accept only those items which are numbers (because once a place is filled it gets a letter X or O)

//create the function bestStpot which takes no argument
    //have it return the first available item created by the empty squares function

//create a function that checks for a tie
    //if there are no more emty squares
        //iterate through the length of all the cells
        //change the background color of each square to green
        //remove the click event listiner
        //call the declareWinner funciton and pass it "Tie game"
